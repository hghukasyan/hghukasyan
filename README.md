## Hayk Ghukasyan — Chief of Engineering

I build backend systems, platforms, and developer tools.

Over the last 20+ years I’ve worked on large production software — from telecom systems to cloud services and high-load platforms. Most of my work focuses on performance, reliability, and long-term maintainability.

My main stack includes Node.js, Go, C++, and cloud infrastructure. I enjoy solving hard problems in distributed systems and building tools that other engineers can rely on.
