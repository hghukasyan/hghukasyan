## Hayk Ghukasyan — Chief of Engineering

Chief Engineer specializing in backend platforms, distributed systems, and high-performance software.

Over 20+ years I’ve built production systems for telecom, cloud infrastructure, and high-load services. My work focuses on reliability, performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability — software that runs in production for years, not just demos.

Core stack includes Node.js, Go, Rust, C++, and cloud technologies. I design systems that handle real traffic, large data volumes, and strict uptime requirements.
